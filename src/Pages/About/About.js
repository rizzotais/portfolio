      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        My name is Tais, and I am a Product UX Designer with a deep passion for
        creating user-centered designs and scalable solutions. With over five years of experience as a clinical
        psychologist in Brazil, I bring a unique perspective to understanding human behavior and needs. Over the past
        few years, I have been honing my skills in technology and design, bridging my expertise in psychology with
        innovative approaches to problem-solving. Now, I am focused on crafting intuitive digital experiences that make
        a meaningful impact.
